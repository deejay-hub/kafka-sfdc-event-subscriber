# Salesforce Platform Events -> Kafka Topics

This is a simple implementation in node that listens to a given platform event then creates a topic in kafka. It demonstrates the ability to create microservices to filter and maintain replayid's that scale independently of the Salesforce core services. The service requires a managed kafka instance to be attached.

# What does the service do?
It uses a nodejs implementation to implement a worker dyno that subscribes to a Salesforce [Platform Event](https://resources.docs.salesforce.com/212/latest/en-us/sfdc/pdf/platform_events.pdf).
The service simply listens to a Salesforce Platform Event and then publishes to a Kafka topic.
